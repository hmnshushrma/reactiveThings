## About the Project

This repository is designed to help developers of all levels learn and understand the key features of React by providing hands-on examples. Whether you're just starting with React or looking to deepen your understanding, this project will guide you through the fundamentals and advanced concepts of the React ecosystem.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed before getting started:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14+)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- A code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Features

- **React Functional Components**: Master building blocks of React with functional components.
- **React Hooks**: Hands-on examples for hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, `useReducer`, and custom hooks.
- **State Management**: Learn state management using both local component state and React Context API.
- **React Router**: Explore navigation and routing between pages.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Understand `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and `React.memo` to optimize rendering.
- **Error Boundaries**: Implement error boundaries to improve user experience.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hmnshushrma/reactiveThings.git
   cd reactiveThings
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Or using yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

## Usage

To start the development server and explore the examples:

```bash
npm start
```

Or using yarn:

```bash
yarn start
```

This will start the app on `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Project Structure

This repository is structured to make navigation easy for learners:

```
/src
  /components    # Reusable UI components
  /hooks         # Examples of custom and built-in hooks
  /pages         # Pages for routing
  /context       # Context API examples
  /utils         # Utility functions
  /errorBoundaries  # Error handling examples
  App.tsx        # Main app component
  index.tsx      # React entry point
```

## Concepts Covered

### Components

- Functional components and their lifecycle.
- Passing props and managing component state.

### Hooks

- **useState**: State management in functional components.
- **useEffect**: Handling side effects and data fetching.
- **useContext**: Sharing state across components.
- **useReducer**: Advanced state management for complex apps.
- **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulate logic for reusability.

### State Management

- Local state management using `useState`.
- Global state management using React Context API.

### Routing

- Routing with `react-router-dom`.
- Implementing dynamic routing and protected routes.

### Error Boundaries

- Error boundaries to catch errors during rendering.

### Performance Optimization

- Avoid unnecessary re-renders with `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback`.
